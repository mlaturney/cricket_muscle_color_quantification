# Muscle color quantification
## Summary

Some insect species selectively break down their flight muscles and divert resources to other phsiological processes (usually reproduction). Previous research that has documented the muscle breakdown noted a color change, with reseachers assigning the colors red, pink, or white. However, these categories are subjective and can vary between researcher. Therefore, we developed a pipeline to quantify muscle color.
